Recordr
======

Recording. No more, no less.

Recordr - Your web-based recording tool
------
Recordr is a cost-effective tool that gives you the opportunity to record on your computer everywhere you want to.
Amazing fact: It's platform independent and browser-based. You can start directly here and now without long downloads and installations.
Everything you need is a computer with a webcam, a microphone, a current browser and an internet connection. No more, no less.

You are no longer bound to locally installed software that produces its own formats and nearly exclude you from further processing. Recordr lets you freely download every single produced file in standardised output formats.
On the one hand you can process your files as you like, e.g. with other programs.
On the other hand there is the possibility to connect with your media server to automate further processing.
